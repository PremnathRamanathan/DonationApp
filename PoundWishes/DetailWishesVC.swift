This is a severe neglect case, because it's obvious that Carley has been starved for a long while. If Carley would not have been taken by the authorities, she would have died of starvation."+"\n"+"Carley is extremely under weight and is in need of immediate veterinary care.  Her immune system has been compromised and she is battling a severe case of staph infection.  Her feet are swollen.  She could barely stand up.  Her hair is falling off, she's running fever and her heart rate is 190.  The vet said it's the worse case of neglect he has seen."+"\n"+"Carley needs lots of medications to treat her skin condition.  She needs pain and anti-inflammatory meds, high dose of antibiotics, medicated baths, itch relief sprays, not to forget, lots of good quality food.   Carley also needs to be seen by a heart specialist to determine the cause for the high heart rate."+"\n"+"In spite of Carley's horrible shape, she loves people, especially those who pet her and scratch her itchy skin. Carley is extremely sweet and loving.  She is good with all people, kids, other dogs, as well as cats.  Once fully recovered, she will make an awesome family pet."
